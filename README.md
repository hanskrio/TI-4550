# TI-4550
This repository contains code for simulating heat pump control scenarios using reinforcement learning, developed as part of the TIÃ˜4550 project thesis. Follow the steps below to set up the boptestgym environment.

## Setup Instructions for the project.

The `boptestgym` environment is used to simulate heat pump optimization scenarios for reinforcement learning tasks. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Python** (version 3.8 or higher)
- **Docker** (for running BOPTEST test cases)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **git** (to clone the repository)
- A **Unix-based system** (Linux/MacOS recommended; Windows with WSL may also work but no guarantees!)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository

- git clone [https://github.com/your-username/TI-4550.git](https://github.com/hanskrio/TI-4550.git)

- cd TI-4550

2. Install Required Python Packages

- Set up a virtual environment (recommended) and install dependencies:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
- On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Set Up BOPTEST

Follow the official instructions to set up BOPTEST:
https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest

4. Set Up boptestgym (see below)

#### Quick-Start (running BOPTEST locally)
Setting up BOPTEST locally provides significant advantages for research and experimentation. 

Note: While the BOPTEST-Service code from [https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest-gym](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest-gym) serves as a useful starting point for exploration, it has several technical constraints. The implemented DQN model parameters, including the batch size of 24 and buffer size of 365*24, are substantially smaller than typically recommended values for reinforcement learning research. Additionally, the 24-hour simulation duration limits the ability to evaluate long-term control strategies and system behaviors. For research applications and experimentation, these default configurations require modification to align with theory.

1. Create a conda environment from the environment.yml file provided (instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)).
2. Run a BOPTEST case with the building emulator model to be controlled (instructions [here](https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest/blob/master/README.md)).
3. Set up an url = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' from your machine to the BOPTEST server. To identify if port 5000 is already in use, you can use the following command in your terminal: `lsof -i :5000`


#### Or, follow the instructions for setting up `boptestgym`from:
https://github.com/ibpsa/project1-boptest-gym

6. Train RL agents or run simulations with already trained agents from this repository :) 

Execute a test script to ensure everything is set up correctly:
TBD

Troubleshooting
- Docker connection issues: Ensure Docker is running, and the container is active.
- Port conflicts: Check if port 5000 is already in use. Modify the `-p` option in the `docker run` command if necessary (e.g., `-p 5001:5000`).
- Dependency errors: Ensure all packages in `requirements.txt` are installed without errors.
